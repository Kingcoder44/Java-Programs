# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

Welcome to the repository for Java programs focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository aims to provide practical implementations and examples of various data structures and algorithms to help with learning and development.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on different data structures and algorithms. Each directory contains Java programs that illustrate the concepts and implementations.

### Directories

- **`arrays`**: Contains implementations of array operations, including searching, sorting, and manipulation techniques.
- **`linkedlists`**: Features implementations of various linked list types such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
- **`stacks`**: Includes stack data structures, implemented using both arrays and linked lists.
- **`queues`**: Contains programs for different queue types, including simple queues, circular queues, and priority queues.
- **`trees`**: Provides implementations of tree structures, such as binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and others.
- **`graphs`**: Features graph-related algorithms and implementations, including traversal (BFS, DFS) and shortest path algorithms (Dijkstraâ€™s, Floyd-Warshall).
- **`heaps`**: Includes implementations of heap data structures, including binary heaps and priority queues.
- **`hashing`**: Provides examples of hash tables and hash functions.
- **`dynamicprogramming`**: Contains programs demonstrating dynamic programming techniques for solving optimization problems.
- **`sorting`**: Features various sorting algorithms, including quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, and bubble sort.
- **`searching`**: Includes searching algorithms such as binary search and linear search.

## Getting Started

To get started with the programs in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

2. **Navigate to a Directory**
   Change to the directory of the data structure or algorithm you want to explore. For example, to access the array-related programs:
   ```sh
   cd your-repo-name/arrays
   ```

3. **Compile a Java Program**
   Compile the Java file using `javac`. Replace `ProgramName.java` with the actual file name:
   ```sh
   javac ProgramName.java
   ```

4. **Run the Program**
   Execute the compiled Java program using `java`:
   ```sh
   java ProgramName
   ```

5. **Explore Other Directories**
   You can similarly navigate to other directories such as `linkedlists`, `stacks`, `queues`, etc., and follow the same steps to compile and run other Java programs.

For instance, to run a sorting algorithm program located in the `sorting` directory:
```sh
cd sorting
javac QuickSort.java
java QuickSort
```

Each directory contains Java files demonstrating specific data structures or algorithms, so you can explore and run them as needed.

```

This streamlined section provides a clear and concise set of instructions for users to start using the repository, regardless of which directory or program they are interested in.
